// As of right now, all of these decals (except raven) are only used by the tile painter. "but Nich, I see these logos all over the place" you say. Well, Turns out that some retard decided that
// the logos you see all over the place should just be regular plaque decals, varedited to use the logo icon-states, instead of actually using their own decals.
// TODO: Replace all the logos on all the maps with these decals. (Except for the raven ones, those are already used.)
// TODO: Once the above has been done, make the arctic logo comply with standards, making AOPU1-7 into AOP8-14. (remember to make the tile-painter comply as well)
